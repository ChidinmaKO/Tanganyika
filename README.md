#### Why Tanganyika?
This repo is named after [Lake Tanganyika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tanganyika) which is the world's longest, second deepest, second oldest and second largest (*by volume*) freshwater lake! It is also the second largest freshwater lake in Africa, second to [Lake Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Victoria). It is divided among four countries. 46% of this lake is in [Tanzania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania), 40% in [the Democratic Republic of the Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo), with the remaining 14% in [Burundi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi) and [Zambia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia).
